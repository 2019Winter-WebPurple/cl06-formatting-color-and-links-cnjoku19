        <!-- The paragraphs are about my early childhood experinences with music, my favorite artists, and how it has helped me -->
        <p>For as long as I can remember, I've been exposed to the beauty of music is several differnt ways. Every Sunday, my family would attend Nigerian Masses spoken in Igbo. Unlike most Catholic Churches in the United States, the sounds of traditional drums, tabourines, and other African instruments was not common. I enjoyed singing and dancing to the beat of the drum with my friends and family. I always looked forward to getting more in touch with my culture and heritage every Sunday!</p>
        
        <p>Aside from Nigerian music, I've always loved hip hop and R&amp;B as well! As of right now, my favorite artists to listen to are H.E.R., King Combs, Summer Walker, and Teyana Taylor. It's gotten to the point where I feel incomplete without listening to these artits while drving, doing homework, or cleaning my room. It's also very rare that you won't hear me having a concert in the shower as well!</p>
        
        <p>Dependig on my mood, I may listen to more upbeat music or somber and slow music. I've found that my favorite artists always seem to sing or rap about situations that I've dealt with or feelings that I've felt. This always makes me feel like I'm not alone in the things that I go through everyday. Music is also an escape from everything else that I have going on in my life because I can just zone everyone and everything out by just putting on earphones.</p>
